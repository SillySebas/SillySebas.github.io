                <p>My programing journey started around the age of 10, at the time I used Python to make my programs. The first actual program I made was a simple "bank" that allowed the user to deposit or withdrawl money from their predetermined balance. Creating this unnecessary and frankly useless program quickly stoked my passion for coding!</p>
                <P>After spending a couple of years learning python and creating smallish programs with it, I moved on to learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. With these tools I began to create websites and games for fun. The highlights of these can be seen in the games tab. I didn't stop there, I also began to create games within the Unity Game Engine. This engine made creating games much easier, allowing my creativity to flow.</P>

                <h1 class="topic_heading">What Are Memes?</h1>
                <p>Memes are a complex idea, yet at face value they are quite simple. From an image that is funny to an image that is deeply sad, either way laughter is the only response to a meme. The internet is the breeding grounds for memes, the speed at which new memes can be created fueling peoples' darkest creativity outlet. Understanding and reason must be thrown out before looking at a meme, because memes do not come from these. Memes are a creation of human emotion, as such only the most shallow emotions can be used to fully take in the glory of a meme. Trying to get what makes a meme funny is useless. Memes seem to be humor itself, without any of the regular requirements needed to evoke laughter within a person. A comedian may struggle as much as the least funny person on earth to create a meme, because a comedian will try to use their understanding of comedy to create a meme. This will be useless, because as previously stated memes cannot come from understanding and reason. </p>
