            <p>Before the game begins, each player will be able to make 6 turns each of either placing or destroying a square. The squares placed within these turns will be unaltered until the game begins. These squares act as the starting game board, so that the players will be able to grow the amount of squares they have!</p>

            <h1>The Game</h1>

            <p>After each player has placed their beginning squares, the game will start. During the game, each player will play a turn. After this, the rules of the board (Shown On The Sides) will be applied, resulting in the new board for the game. This will repeat until the max amount of turns have been reached.</p>

            <h1>The End</h1>
            <p>Once the max amount of turns has been reached, the game will end. Whoever has the most squares left on the board will win the game. If the amount of squares each player has is equal, the game will be a tie.</p>
